Fool Bike
=========

A little toy bike app for iOS. It came into being because I wanted to try
MapKit, CoreLocation and HealthKit once. (And Runtastic's missing auto pause on
iOS sucks.)

It's UI is full of debugging like markers for special events and a logging
console on the bottom, so this is nothing you'd want to use on a daily basis.
